## Meeting 09.03.2023

### Outcomes:

- We will document the whole project on GitHub in the documentation repo.
- Each outcome and discussion is documented in a markdown file which is created for every team meeting.
- We use SCRUM as project management method. Therefore we'll use sub-team specific Kanban Boards to document the Story-Cards and corresponding tasks.

We decided that Dennis Hilgert will take over the position as SCRUM Master beside the role as normal developer. Responsibilities:
- Scheduling two weekly standups with all team members, one on Mondays, the other one in the lecture on Thursdays.
- Create and initially structure the Kanban Boards for each sub team to implement project management.
- Make sure that all sub teams keep on the right track and focus on their tasks
- Help the teams to remove blockers and other problems

The Kanban Boards will have the following columns:
- Backlog (Cards that are defined and free of blockers but not in doing yet)
- Doing (Cards on which the developers actively work)
- Review/Test (Cards that are finsihed with implemenation but need code review and testing)
- Done (Cards that are successfully code reviewed and tested)
- Released (Cards that are releaed to the main branch)

A sprint has a duration of two weeks. Sprint Plannings, Refinements and -Reviews will happen of the corresponding point of time.
