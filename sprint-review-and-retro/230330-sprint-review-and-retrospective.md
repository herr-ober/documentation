## Retrospective 30.03.2023

- estimating Story Points is difficult with team members with different skill levels
- Story Points werent split/estimated for backend/frontend-> estimate Story Points independent for backend/frontend, individual cards in the kanban board for backend frontend
- kanban tool in github not apropriate (generating charts not possible) -> design charts manually
- many underestimated dependencies (base in backend missing) -> partly already solved, partly see next point
- no api specification -> specify api in cards (backend)
- merges close to sprint end causes conflicts-> merge deadline tuesday before sprint end
- general problems in git -> daily rebase, merge only when fature is done, precise reviewing when merges concern central functionalities
