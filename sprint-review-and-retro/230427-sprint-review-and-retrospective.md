## Review Notes
- During this sprint review we discussed that it is necessary for organizers to change their account infromation. Therefore a new user story card has been added to the user story map. It is called „update organizer account“. The „has to“ section of the product has been updated as well.
- Also all points of the „can to“ section have been achieved during this sprint.
## Retrospective 27.04.2023

- Some commit messages and card names were not set properly in the past. The importance of correct naming has been stressed in this retro
- For more naming options the category „Improvement“ has been added to the documentation
- Code changes shall be reviewed more carefully to reduce possible faults in code
- For future documentation the category „Documentation“ has been added to the documentation
