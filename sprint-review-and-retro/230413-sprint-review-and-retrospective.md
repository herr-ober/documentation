## Retrospective 30.03.2023
- User stories were processed twice because two people were assigned to the issue -> Agree beforehand which person will process the issue and remove it from the card
- When API specifications are changed, also change the issue cards to avoid developing on different endpoints
- In order to avoid consequential errors, fixes are discussed as early as possible and solved together in the group
