### Outcomes

- Change team allocation from tasks fixed to teams towards request driven allocation of tasks to teams. 
- Team kitchen is now called Team Alpha and team waiter is now team Delta. Team members will be kept the same. 
- Reason for this change is that there is a new frontend part for the organizer of the event which impaired the strict division of teams. The change allows for more flexible allocation of tasks to teams.
- Jannis Worbs is new mebember of Herr Ober startup and allocated to team Delta.
- Backlogs are now divided into sprint backlog and global backlog. Sprint backlog only contains relevant tasks for current sprint phase.
- Frontend teams deciced to hold a spike in which the knowledges will be leveled and a template will be created.
